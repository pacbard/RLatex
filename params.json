{"name":"Rlatex","tagline":"A CLSI command line client.","body":"# RLatex\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage: `python rlatex.py [options] inputfile.tex`\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n```\r\n    -h, --help:         print this message\r\n    -s, --server:       the CLSI server to contact\r\n    -a, --api_url:      API URl on the server\r\n    -t, --token:        your token\r\n    -f, --file:         get login information from a file\r\n    -c, --compiler      sets the LaTeX Compiler\r\n    -o, --output        sets the LaTeX output file\r\n    -l, --log:          saves the log file\r\n    -d, --debug:        debug version of the script\r\n    --async             compiles asynchronously\r\n```\r\nYou can hard-code the filename from which to read login information into\r\nthe rlatex script. Command-line arguments take precedence over\r\nthe contents of that file. See the RLaTeX documentation for formatting\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIf any of the server, api_url, and token are omitted, you will be\r\nasked to provide them.\r\n\r\nRLatex supports multiple compilers and output formats:\r\n```\r\n    pdflatex    pdf\r\n    latex       dvi, pdf, ps\r\n    xelatex     pdf\r\n    standalone  png, jpg, tiff, bmp\r\n```\r\nIf the compiler and/or the output format are not specified as arguments,\r\nRLatex will use ```pdflatex``` as compiler and ```pdf``` as output format. For this\r\nreason, most user will not need to specify a compiler or output formats.\r\n\r\nIf the ```standalone``` compiler option is selected, please refer to the ```standalone``` \r\npackage documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous Compilation\r\nAsynchronous compilation is supported using the parameter ```--async```.  In this \r\ncase, the connection to the server will be closed once the files are uploaded and\r\nthe script will check at given time intervals if the compilation was completed.\r\n\r\nPlease, note that at this time there is a bug in the CLSI server.  Asynchronous\r\ncompilation returns a **404 error** if the compilation is in progress instead of the\r\nexpected \"**compilation in progress**\" message.\r\n\r\n### Compile to Windows Executible\r\nIt is possible to compile this script to a one Windows executible using ```pyinstaller rlatex.py```.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSee the RLaTeX documentation for more details on usage and limitations\r\nof rlatex.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nRLatex - A CLSI command line client.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013  Emanuele Bardelli <bardellie@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
